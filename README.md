# Diabetes-Retinopathy-Detection
Project aims to develop an AI-based solution that can automatically classify retinal images into different  stages of diabetic retinopathy.

0. No DR – The retina is healthy, with no signs of DR.
1. Mild – Small microaneurysms are present, an early sign of DR.
2. Moderate – More blood vessels are affected, but vision is still functional.
3. Severe – A significant number of blood vessels are blocked, and vision is at risk.
4.Proliferative DR – The most advanced stage, with abnormal blood vessel growth that can lead to blindness.
